# IMDB Sentiment Analysis

This project builds a **sentiment analysis model** using the IMDB movie reviews dataset.  
The dataset contains 50,000 reviews labeled as **positive** or **negative**.  
We preprocess the text, transform it using **TF-IDF**, and train a **Logistic Regression model** to classify reviews.  

### Results
- Accuracy: ~88%
- Model: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features  

### Dataset
The dataset is too large to include in this repo.
